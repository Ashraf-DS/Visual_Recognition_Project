# Visual_Recognition_Project
Visual Recognition Project on CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)

# Play with CNNs
## • CIFAR-10 dataset
## • AlexNet has 5 Conv and 3 FC layers
## • Play with a medium deep network with atleast 2 conv and 2 FC layers.
## • Metrics: training time and classiﬁcation performance
## • Compare ReLU vs tanh vs sigmoid
## • With and without momentum, adaptive learning rates
• Finally: what would be your recommended architecture..

# CNN as a feature extracter
## • Pick your favourite object recognition dataset, other than CIFAR/MNIST so we chosen Intel dataset
## • Use Alexnet/any deep NN as a feature extracter (extract last layer as features),
## use any model on top and report the classiﬁcation accuracies
## • Report accuracies for Bike vs Horses dataset also

# Auto detection
## • Build an “auto” detector using Faster RCNN/YOLO based methods (one of the above) so we have done through YOLO V3 and YOLO V5
• We will give you some auto image data as a starting point, feel free to add or use any other data, or annotate this data (notes folder) so we also taken more images file from Kaggle.
• Document where the method works well or fails
